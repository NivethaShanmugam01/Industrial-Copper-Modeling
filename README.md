# Industrial-Copper-Modeling

## Project Overview
The Industrial Copper Modeling project aims to address challenges in the copper industry related to sales and pricing. The project involves the development of machine learning models for predicting selling prices and classifying leads as either successful (WON) or unsuccessful (LOST).

## Skills Developed
- Python Scripting
- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Machine Learning Regression
- Machine Learning Classification
- Streamlit for Web Application Development

## Problem Statement
The copper industry faces issues with skewed and noisy data affecting the accuracy of manual predictions. The project seeks to automate and optimize pricing decisions through the use of machine learning regression models. Additionally, a lead classification model is developed to evaluate and classify leads based on the likelihood of conversion.
